String is immutable..
StringBuilder is a class and it represents a mutable string..

It provides more methods for manipulating strings..So use it more when we deal with situations which contain manipulation of strings

Ex:

Append()
Insert()
Remove()
Replace()
Clear()

=> Only manipulation methods no searching methods
