byte number = 255;
number += 1;

Console.WriteLine(number);

This program gives 0 as output. This is overflowing.. If we go beyond the boundary of dataType, we will get overflow.

To stop overflowing we need to use checked keyword..
checked
{
	byte number = 255;
	number += 1;
}

By using checked keyword overflow will not happen and throws an exception.
