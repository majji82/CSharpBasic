In C# there are 5 types of operators:

- Arithematic
- Comparison
- Assignment
- Logical
- Bitwise

Arithematic operators:
	Used in computations (basically with numbers) Ex: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Remainder, Increment and Decrement

	a++ => a=a+1
	a-- => a=a-1

	b = a++ is postfix => first a is assigned to b, then a is incremented
	b = ++a is prefix  => first a is incremented and then it is assigned to b

Comparison Operators:
	Equal, NotEqual, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqualTo, LessThan, LessThanOrEqualTo 
	[==, !=, >, >=, <, <=]

Assignment operators:
	=, +=, -=, *=, /=
	a+=3 => a=a+3
	a/=4 => a=a/4

Logical Operators:
	Used in boolean expressions often used in conditional statements.
	[&&, ||, !] 
	let x = a && b => if both a and b is true then x is true
	let x = a||b   => if either a or b is true, then x is true

Bitwise Operators:
	& => And => Bitwise and
	| => Or => Bitwise Or

Note:
	Multiplication and Division Has higher presedence than add/subtract
	We can change the presendence by using paranthesis.
	Result of comparison expression is always a boolean value (either true or false)
