Dates And Times in C#

There is a DateTime() in C# with which we can work on Dates And Times using pre-built functions.
We can also work on current DateTime using DateTime.Now...As Current DateTime cannot be different it must be a static one..so we directly access it with DateTime instead of the object

Ex: var now = DateTime.Now;
