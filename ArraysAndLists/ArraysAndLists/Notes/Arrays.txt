Arrays:

Represents fixed no of variables with a particular type

There are two types of arrays:
1. Single dimenisonal
2. Multi dimensional

Single dimensional:
	var numbers = new int[5]{1,2,3,4,5}; // Object initialization syntax

Multi dimensional arrays:
These are again divided into rectangular and jagged arrays.
Rectangular:
	Each row has exactly same no of columns
Jagged:
	Each row can have different columns....It is like array of arrays..

Syntax for 2D rectangular array:

var matrix = new int[3,5];
var matrix = new int[3,2]
{
	{1,2},
	{3,4},
	{5,6}
};

Accessing elements :  matrix[rowIndex][columnIndex];

// This is 3D array
var matrix = new int[2,3,4];

Jagged Array:

Syntax:

var array = new int[3][];
array[0] = new int[3];
array[1] = new int[4];

Accessing elements: array[0][5];
