Arrays:

Array is a data-structure to store a collection of variables of same type.

Declaration:

dataType[] varName = new dataType[arraySize];
Ex: int[] numbers = new int[3];

It has a new operator which means we have to allocate memory specifically..

Accessing elements:

Elements in an array are 0-indexed
They can be accessed using indexes with square brackets..Ex: num[0], num[1] etc...

Note: When we declare an array and not assign a value, it will automatically set to default value..

Int => default values => 0
boolean => false
