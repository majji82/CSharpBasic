Strings:

String is a sequence of characters.
Ex: "Hello World"

Creating strings:

1. string name = "Janardhan"
2. string name = firstName + " " + lastName
3. string name = string.Format("{0} {1}", firstName, lastName)	[Format is a static method]
{0} {1} are placeHolders
4. 

	int nums = new int[3]{1,2,3};
	string list = string.Join(",", nums);

Accessing characters of string:

Characters of string can be accessed using indexes (0,1,2 etc...)
ex: char firstChar = list[0]

Note: Strings are immutable (Once created cannot be changed)
The original string is not changed no matter what

Escape Characters:

\n => new line
\t => Tab
\\ => Backslash
\' => Single quote
\" => Double quote

Verbatim strings:

string path = "C:\\projects\\lenovo\\folder" => looks like a bit messy so we use
string path = @"C:\projects\lenovo\folder"
