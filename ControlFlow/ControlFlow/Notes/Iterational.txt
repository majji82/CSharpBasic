Iteration statements:

Repeatedly execting sequence of statements.

For loop
for(initialization; condition Clause; iteration clause)
{
	// code [sequence of statements]
}

ForEach (for list/array natured)

foreach(var number(temp var) in numbers(list name))
{
	// code
}

while loop

while(condition)
{
	// code
}

do-while

do
{
	//
	i++;
}while(condition)

do while loop executes atleast once as the condition is checked at the end...

break; => jump out of the loop
continue; => continue to the next iteration

Note: while loop is mostly used when we donot know exactly how many times the loop iterates
