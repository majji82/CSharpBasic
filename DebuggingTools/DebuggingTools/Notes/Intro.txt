If we get an unexpected result then there must be some error in the code..This can be caught using breakpoints
Run the application using debug mode by using breakpoints...In this way the execution stops at the breakpoint.

F9 =>  BreakPoint
F5 => Run in debug mode
Ctrl + f5 => run without debug
F10 => stepover (1 line at a time)
F11 => stepInto
Shift + f11 => Stepout
shift + f5 => stop debugger

If we open the watch window...then we can give the variable name so that we get the values backin return..

Removing side effects:

Whenever we write a code, we take the input and display the output...make sure that the input must not be changed...This is called removing side effects.

=> Donot modify the external state...
=> Don't alter global variables..etc are some examples of side effects...

Defensive Programming:

Check the input first before processing it..
Check for null values, check the data type and the data's range
=> It is safe to specify what is allowed than to list not allowed one's

Watch window:
If we open the watch window...then we can give the variable name so that we get the values backin return..
	

CallStack:

It helps us to know in what order the functions are executed..from current to the first function (The order of function calls)

Locals and autos window:
Autos window is like watch window but we no leonger need to specify variables..It gives all the variables..

Locals window:
Shows the variables same like autos window but in local scope
